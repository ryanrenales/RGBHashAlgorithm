# RGB Hash Algorithm

## Dependencies

Ensure the imported dependencies are installed.

`pip install pillow numpy opencv-python`

## Test Images

Test images will be available for download in this repository. You may also test your own images as well.
Ensure desired images are downloaded in the same folder as the `.py` file.

### Example:

`img1 = 'image1.jpg'`

`img2 = 'image2.jpg'`

Images are assigned to these variables, which can be found below the function definitions.
To change the image, change the name to your desired image name.


## Run

After you install dependencies, images, and assign desired images to the img variables, you may run the program and
interpret the results between the four hash functions. There will be a total of four results for the four algorithms which
show the images unique hexadecimal hash value, the hamming distance between the two compared images, and the similarity score
of the two images.
